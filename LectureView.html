	 <h2>Lectures</h2>
	 <h3>Lecture 1 - Introduction </h3>
	 <p>I have added some code that equates to the stuff I scribbled on the whiteboard. The Circle and Cylinder Classes.
        It is a NetBeans Project that is zipped up.

        See if you can identify all the implementations and usages of polymorphism in this code and add comments at the appropriate points identifying what type of polymorphism it is (from the lecture notes).  Also see if you can create a UML diagram which represents this code.  </p>
	<br>
	 <h3>Lecture 2 - Multi-Paradigm Programming</h3>
	 <p>"UPDATE: 
         v2: I have added a generic class called TwoThings for holding two objects of the same type (and sub-types). Just because I can! Similar to 'Box' in the 'Parameterised Types (Generics)' link below
         v3: A finesse on the hierarchy of the interfaces Shape2D or Shape3D - messes up the UML. Is this the way to do it? What changes here?

         I also have some links below which I mentioned during the lecture and cover both this week and last week (Collections and generics)</p>
	 <br>
	 <h3>Lecture 3 - OO Languages</h3>
	 <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,</p>
	 <br>
	 <h3>Lecture 4 - OO Fundamentals </h3>
	 <p>Java Collections Framework - implementation of Parametric Polymorphism written using Parameterised Types (Generics) this is equivalent to Template Functions and Classes in C++
     Another typology of Polymorphism - this is broadly similar to the typology presented in the lectures and is a reasonably digestible discussion with examples, that will give you another perspective. Sometimes the naming is different. Taken from 'An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming' 2nd Edition, Timothy Budd, Addison Wesley 1997. 1997?! Nothing new under the Sun!  .</p>
	<br>
	 <h3>Lecture 5 - Inheritance</h3>
	 <p> I have added some code to illustrate reading and writing data, creating objects, storing in ArrayLists and setting up Many to  Many Association relationships

       Consider the approach used to help you to understand the concepts behind Collections, Association relationships and storing and retrieval of objects.
       Consider the approach used to help you to fix any storage issues you may have in your application
       One thing to consider is how one might preserve the relationships (created by the random procedures in my sample.</p>
	 <br>
	 <h3>Lecture 6 - Inheritance & Case study</h3>
	 <p>HEALTH WARNING - DON'T TRY AND REDESIGN YOUR APPLICATION AROUND THIS!!!!!
       IF YOU DO THEN IT IS TOO LATE OR YOU HAVE ONLY JUST STARTED
       WE WANT TO SEE THE SOLUTIONS YOUR GROUP HAVE COME UP WITH. NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE USED TO ILLUSTRATE CONCEPTS

       I will not appreciate seeing this code again - it's purely for educational purposes and will crop up later in the module
       I will especially not like to see the viewer code. It is purely to show the program doing something and to show the relationships that have been setup
       A good usable console interface requires thought, application and design. It will be rewarded commensurately.</p>
