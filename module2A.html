	 <h3>Fujitsu on Campus</h3>
	     <p>Fujitsu on Campus

            Fujitsu will be coming to campus on 24th February to host an exclusive talk for KU students. Don’t miss this opportunity to hear from one of Fujitsu’s distinguished Cyber Security Engineers. The session will include a presentation on forensic analysis of a memory dump, and some network traffic.


            The technical demonstration will focus on the gathering of artefacts associated with malware infections, collected from an infected host, and how Fujitsu identify the infection process and any network traffic from the host. Fujitsu will highlight some key tools and resources used to enable these investigations and provide a real world example of identifying and tracking a banking Trojan affecting UK PLC.


            A Q&amp;A will follow the talk.
            2pm Wednesday 24th Feb 2016, JG1004

	 <h3>Late marking of the IP Addressing Design coursework</h3>
	     <p>"Dear Students

          Unfortunately the marking of the "Designing an IP Addressing Scheme" coursework is seriously late. Many have been only partially marked and these partial marks have inadvertently appeared on the GradeCentre leading some of you to worry. Apologies - these are not the final marks.

          I will find out when the marking will be completed and get back to you.

          (On the up side we still have time to get these marks back to you in the mandatory 20 working days but I admit we have failed to live   up to our school's expectation to get these back to you within three weeks. Apologies.)

         Regards

         Graeme</p>

	 <h3>Computer Architecture reference</h3>
	    <p>Dear Students,


           The book we are using for the Computer architecture topic is as follows:


           Computer Organization and Design, The hardware/Software Interface,  David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy.  There are many versions in our library and the latest one is the 5th editions 2014.


            We are covering chapters 1, 2, 4 and 5 of this book only.


            Thanks


           Nada </p>

	 <h3>Teaching next week</h3>
	     <p>"Dear Students,

              As you know I will be teaching you Computer Architecture over the next five weeks. For NEXT WEEK ONLY we will be having a LECTURE  ONLY and NO WORKSHOPS. The  lecture as you know is between 9am and 11am on Monday.  During the lecture I will talk about the 1st topic that we need to cover in Computer Architecture, then I will talk about your assignment which counts as 25% of your module and finally I will give you some homework that you need to work on during next week in your own time. So attending the lecture next week is VERY important. 



              Please contact me if you have any question.

              Best regards


              Nada Philip</p>
